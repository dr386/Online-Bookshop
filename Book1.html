                    <p>
                        For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast.
                        So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl.
                        But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand.
                        Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world,
                        a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were,
                        and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.

                        <h4>Amazon.com Review</h4>
                        <p>
                            An Amazon Best Book of August 2018: Although this is Delia Owens’ first novel, she long ago distinguished herself as a gifted writer.
                            In the mid-80s, Owens co-wrote with her husband Cry of the Kalahari, which was a best-selling, nonfictional account of traveling and researching Africa’s Kalahari Desert.
                            One of the joys of that book was the Owens’ description of the natural world, and Where the Crawdads Sing is immersed in the natural world as well.
                            The story is set in the 1950s and revolves around a young woman named Kya Clark, who is from extremely rural North Carolina. Known by others as the Marsh Girl,
                            she lives alone in nature—but the draw of other people, and specifically love, brings her into contact with the greater world. This novel has a mystery at its core,
                            but it can be read on a variety of levels. There is great nature writing; there is coming of age; and there is literature.
                            Crawdads is a story lovingly told—one that takes its time in developing its characters and setting, and in developing the story.
                            You’ll want to relax and take your time as well, and when you’re done you will want to talk about it with another reader. – Chris Schluep , Amazon Book Review

                        <h4>New York Times Book Review</h4>
                        <p>
                            A painfully beautiful first novel that is at once a murder mystery, a coming-of-age narrative and a celebration of nature....
                            Owens here surveys the desolate marshlands of the North Carolina coast through the eyes of an abandoned child.
                            And in her isolation that child makes us open our own eyes to the secret wonders—and dangers—of her private world.
