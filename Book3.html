                        <p>
                            Tara Westover is an American author living in the UK. Born in Idaho to a father opposed to public education, she never attended school. 
                            She spent her days working in her father's junkyard or stewing herbs for her mother, a self-taught herbalist and midwife. She was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom, 
                            and after that first taste, she pursued learning for a decade. She graduated magna cum laude from Brigham Young University in 2008 and was subsequently awarded a Gates Cambridge Scholarship. 
                            She earned an MPhil from Trinity College, Cambridge in 2009, and in 2010 was a visiting fellow at Harvard University. She returned to Cambridge, where she was awarded a PhD in history in 2014.

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        An unforgettable memoir about a young girl who, kept out of school, leaves her survivalist family and goes on to earn a PhD from Cambridge University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. 
                        Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. 
                        When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, 
                        to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she’d traveled too far, if there was still a way home.

                        <h4>Amazon.com Review</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tara Westover wasn’t your garden variety college student. When the Holocaust was mentioned in a history class, she didn’t know what it was (no, really). 
                            That’s because she didn’t see the inside of a classroom until the age of seventeen. Public education was one of the many things her religious fanatic father was dubious of, 
                            believing it a means for the government to brainwash its gullible citizens, and her mother wasn’t diligent on the homeschooling front. 
                            If it wasn’t for a brother who managed to extricate himself from their isolated—and often dangerous--world, Westover might still be in rural Idaho, 
                            trying to survive her survivalist upbringing. It’s a miraculous story she tells in her memoir Educated. For those of us who took our educations for granted, 
                            who occasionally fell asleep in large lecture halls (and inconveniently small ones), it’s hard to grasp the level of grit—not to mention intellect—required to pull off what Westover did. 
                            But eventually earning a PhD from Cambridge University may have been the easy part, at least compared to what she had to sacrifice to attain it. 
                            The courage it took to make that sacrifice was the truest indicator of how far she’d come, and how much she’d learned. Educated is an inspiring reminder that knowledge is, indeed, power. <br />

                            Westover has somehow managed not only to capture her unsurpassably exceptional upbringing, but to make her current situation seem not so exceptional at all, and resonant for many others.
