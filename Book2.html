                            Michelle Robinson Obama served as First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A
                            graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School,
                            Mrs. Obama started her career as an attorney at the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where
                            she met her future husband, Barack Obama.
                            She later worked in the Chicago mayor’s office, at the University of Chicago, and at the
                            University of Chicago Medical Center. Mrs. Obama also founded the Chicago chapter of Public
                            Allies,
                            an organization that prepares young people for careers in public service.

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most
                        iconic and compelling women of our era.
                        As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that
                        role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history,
                        while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and
                        around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active
                        lives,
                        and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments.
                        Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke,
                        and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.

                    <p>
                        In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites
                        readers into her world,
                        chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago
                        to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work,
                        to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she
                        describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private,
                        telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise,
                        and revelatory,
                        Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily
                        defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.

                        <h4>Amazon.com Review</h4>
                        <p>
                            I believe I always loved Michelle Obama. Her grace and dignity always seemed to come as a
                            gift from above. Her spirit is so incredibly deep and strong. The stories from her
                            childhood, her brother, her neighborhood, her family, inform us in a brilliant voice about
                            what it was like in the place and time she grew up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Michelle Obama has the empathy and the depth of character so missing in her media portrayal.
                            I always felt worried that we were suffocating her. But there is a Michelle Obama who is
                            bigger than the words on a page. She knows our pains, and she understands our lives. And we
                            know her in this book. In this most private book, we know her in a way we could not have
                            otherwise. Interesting that nothing here surprises me, it only affirms what I felt like I
                            know: Michelle Obama is a person like us. She worked and suffered and overcame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her storytelling skills are exquisite. It left me a little breathless to hear her voice,
                            unfettered and real.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love the photographs.

                        <p>
                            Obama writes with a refreshing candor, as though her keen awareness of her celebrity is
                            matched only by her eagerness to shed the exhausting veneer that helped enable her husband’s
                            political rise.
