                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, 
                        Rachel Hollis developed an immense online community by sharing tips for better living while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life. Now, 
                        in this challenging and inspiring new book, Rachel exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, 
                        lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With painful honesty and fearless humor, Rachel unpacks and examines the falsehoods that once left her feeling overwhelmed and unworthy, 
                        and reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt,
                        all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be.

                        <p>
                            I do actually recommend the audiobook version because you really feel the impact of this book, when read by Rachel Hollis herself. 
                            But if you aren't in a place to listen, I think EVERY woman needs to read this book. Over and over and over! I have read or listened to it about 5 times now. 
                            I know I need these words repeated and engraved in my brain to improve my life, to reset my brain and how i talk to myself, to appreciate what I have, and get the tough talk I need and deserve.
                            Rachel feels like your best friend and you love her, even when her message is tough to swallow. But she's right. And she tells it like it is. 
                            I have had the opportunity to see her present to a group and she's genuine and funny and lovable - and one tough cookie! You NEED her!
